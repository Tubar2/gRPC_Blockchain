# gRPC_Blockchain
A progressing implementation of blockchain using go and gRPC

The first one "1-SingleServer_MultiClient" contains a single server where a blockchain copy is stored. Multiple users can be created and access the chain stored in that server.

The second one, "2-MultiServer_MultiClient", is a more real implementation, where each server contains it's own chain. The instructions to start a server is in the readme file in that folder.
